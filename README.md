# `ts-patch` test in `typescript@5.7`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samchon/ts-patch-typescript-5.7
npm install --force
npm run build
npm start
```

Tested my implementation is working well in the `ts-patch install` command.

However, not implemented the `tspc` script, because I don't know how to \o/.
